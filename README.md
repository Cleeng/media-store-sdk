# Installation

MediaStore SDK repo is marked as a template so you can easily move it directly to your GitHub account. Just use `Use this template` option.

<img src="src/assets/images/use_template.png" />
<img src="src/assets/images/create_repo.png" />

Upon creating the repository, please proceed with the below steps

1. Clone repo to your pc (use the link from your GitHub if you used a template)

`git clone https://github.com/Cleeng/media-store-sdk`

2. Go to the repo (name can be changed if you use a template)

`cd media-store-sdk`

3. Install packages with yarn

`yarn install`

4. Create a script in `src/config/environments` containing setups for the development environment.

Here is an example of a file to connect to the sandbox. You can use it for your development.

```
module.exports = {
  ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION: {
    GB_API_URL: JSON.stringify('https://connect-sandbox.cleeng.com'),
    ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY: JSON.stringify('test_I4OFGUUCEVB5TI222AS3N2Y2LY6PJM3K'), //write to us to origin whitelist
  }
};
```

All the configs defined in `src/config/environments` can be accessed in code via a global ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION constant.

To select a specific environment for a run or build, use the `--environment` flag, e.g. `yarn start --environment=production`.

Scripts containing setups are in js format. `staging.js` and `development.js` files are not committed and are ignored via .gitignore. That’s why you will need to create a local file and set some variables within it.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Configuration</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>GB_API_URL</td><td>identifies the host of REST API</td></tr>
<tr><td>ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY</td>
  <td>
    identifies Adyen's Client Key. It’s a Cleeng key, which allows you to use Adyen enpoint (when Cleeng is MoR). To use it we need to add your origin to allowed ones.
    Testing: 
      `test_I4OFGUUCEVB5TI222AS3N2Y2LY6PJM3K`
    Production: 
      `live_BQDOFBYTGZB3XKF62GBYSLPUJ4YW2TPL`
  </td></tr>
</table>

5. Runs the app in the development mode, using

`yarn start`

Open `http://localhost:3003` to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

That’s it! Your own MediaStore SDK app is running locally.

Below you can find a list with available scripts.

<table>
<tr>
    <th>Command</th>
    <th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>yarn build</td>
<td>Builds the app for production to the build folder.
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
  The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
  Your app is ready to be deployed!
  See the section about <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/" target="_blank">deployment</a> for more information.
  </td></tr>
<tr><td>yarn test</td>
  <td>

  </td></tr>
<tr><td>yarn storybook</td>
  <td>

# Project overview

## MediaStore SDK

MediaStore SDK includes a best practice <b>checkout</b> and <b>myAccount</b> example using Cleeng API. MediaStore SDK consists of components that will empower you to build and design a seamless checkout process and help visitors become subscribers and then to manage their subscription to your service in an intuitive and trusted manner.

This repo is an example app as a set of instructions and code snippets for the web to help implement tailored and custom checkout.

It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Check the demo [here](https://webstoresdk-demo.cleeng.com/login?offer=S817681481_PL&publisher=933103327).

## Features

### User Account

1. Authentication - login form, the registration form (with consents approval) and ability to reset a password

### Checkout

This ultimate checkout application is implemented as a full flow for a user, with payment by card possible through Adyen and PayPal v1. These payment methods can be replaced by others.

1. Offer/Product display - offer details display with information about the trial, coupon codes application and price breakdown

2. Payment - dynamically loaded payment methods with <b>Adyen and PayPal v1 integration</b> (as an example payment integration) and thank you page after successful offer purchase

### MyAccount

MyAccount part is a solution for customers to manage their subscriptions. It is divided into 3 blocks with the following features:

1. Plan details

a. details about the current plans with the option to unsubscribe or resubscribe

2. Payment info

a. information about current payment method

b. list of transactions

3. Update profile

a. update name, last name, and email

b. change password

c. consents management

## Architecture overview

MediaStore SDK is a Frontend application build with React. It was bootstrapped with Create React App. We are using webpack to build it, Jest, and Enzyme for testing, Styled Components for styles.

This application is communicating with the backend REST API. All methods available can be found [here](https://developers.apidoc.cleeng.com/reference/getting-started).

<b>The app requires few params to working properly. </b>

To enable login action pass `offerId` to the app. Login is also possible using `publisherId`, but in the sample app, we use `offerId`. You can pass it in two ways:

In URL as a param `?offer=S1234567` and this is the most important one

In local storage as `CLEENG_OFFER_ID`

To enable registration, pass `publisherId` which is required to fetch terms and conditions.

Similarly, `publisherId` can be passed to the app in 2 ways:

In URL as a param `?publisher=123456789` and this is the most important one

In local storage as `CLEENG_PUBLISHER_ID`

## Authentication

To authenticate - we are using JWT with the payload containing `customerId`, `publisherId`, and `expiration date`. You can decode JWT using packages like [`jwt-decode`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jwt-decode) or if you want only check it use online decoder [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).

JWT is valid for 30 minutes and after it, the customer is logged out.

JWT is required for the most part of API calls. It is returned after successful login and registration requests.

## Translations

We provide full flexibility to adjust messaging in the checkout process and the myAccount app. All the content in the MediaStore pages can be translated into 28 languages, but these translations can also be overwritten if you choose so.

## Style Guide

### Files

Each component should have an accompanying `ComponentStyled.js` file which contains `styled-components` objects for this component.

### CSS Property Order

Keep CSS props in the following order, with empty newlines between sections:

- Layout Properties (position, float, clear, display)
- Box Model Properties (width, height, margin, padding)
- Visual Properties (color, background, border, box-shadow)
- Typography Properties (font-size, font-family, text-align, text-transform)
- Misc Properties (cursor, overflow, z-index)
